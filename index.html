            <p>Hello there! Here's a little something about my background. It has been a long journey of what we called "Life"
                for me. Came across so many variations of obstacles growing up. When I was 9 years old, my sister and I migrated
                here in Chicago from the Philippines to be with our father and to have a "better" life. Our childhood was
                not made easy and didn't have a normal upbringing which made it a bit of a challenge for my sister and me.</p>

            <p>I have learned to earn money and how to work hard in order to survive in this world! I also have learned that
                in order to get what you want in life, you have to be determined and motivated. Things are not always going
                to be made easy and peachy but You are the only person that can change your future so it does not stop here.
                With a design background, I am here in hopes to expand my knowledge in technology and to become more marketable
                in this growing IT industry! Hope you enjoy this short story of mine! </p>
